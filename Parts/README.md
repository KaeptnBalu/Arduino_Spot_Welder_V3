<b>For a complete parts list take a look at the BOM file</b>

These are the parts you need to buy for building the Spot Welder V3. With the Mouser.com Shop Link you can directly ad all electronic component parts to your shopping cart. 

Not included in the Mouser shopping cart:
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 1x OLED Display

Parts I bought at the local hardware store:

- 1x piece of 16x70mm aluminium about 3 or 4mm thick
- Some 16mmÂ² cable and short piece of thick solid copper wire for the probes tips

You can get ready made welding cables, aluminum parts and pcb sets at www.malectrics.eu if you dont want to make them yourself.
