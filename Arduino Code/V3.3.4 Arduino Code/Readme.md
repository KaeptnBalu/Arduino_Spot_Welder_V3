This is V3.3.4 of the Arduino Code

Improvements:

- fix weld counter, it can now count up to 65535
- add over volatge warning when input voltage is 14.5 V or higher

When upgrading from an earlier V3 version of the Arduino Code to this one you need to perform a full reset of the welder in the system menu after the update.
